    <p>Dear Ms. Lodhi</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      A cover letter is a three- or four-paragraph document to an employer
      explaining your interest in a specific job. It’s a one-page letter that is
      usually attached to your resume. This letter should also highlight your
      fitness for the advertised role. <br /><br />
      Writing a cover letter as a mid-career professional is a bit different.
      But first, start with how you found out about the career opening and why
      you’re interested in the job position. Be specific: use the correct names
      and titles. <br /><br />
      As you write this letter, use clear and readable words. You want to come
      across as professional and approachable, but not overly formal.
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>Next, provide examples of why you’re the right person for the job.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Don’t hesitate to use bullet points and include numbers that showcase
        your achievements.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rather than simply describe what you’ve done in previous jobs, show the
        recruiter or hiring manager what you can bring to the role.
      </li>
      <li>
        Express your passion and excitement to be part of the company and the
        team.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Finally, provide your contact information and how you prefer to be
      reached. Offer to meet with the reader at their earliest convenience.
      Thank them for their time and attention, and let them know that you look
      forward to hearing from them soon.
      <br /><br />
      Before you send your cover letter, read your draft out loud to quickly
      spot errors and wordy sentences. You can also ask a friend to review your
      cover letter. Good luck on your job search.
    </p>
    <br /><br /><br />
    <span>Sincerely</span>
    <br /><br /><br /><br />
    <span>Tanya Sehgal</span>
